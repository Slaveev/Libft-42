# First project in 42 coding school. You have to create a library that you can use in future projects

• isalpha • isdigit • isalnum • isascii • isprint • strlen • memset • bzero
• memcpy • memmove • strlcpy • strlcat
• toupper • tolower • strchr • strrchr • strncmp • memchr • memcmp • strnstr • atoi
• calloc • strdup • ft_substr • ft_strjoin • ft_strtrim ft_split • ft_itoa • ft_strmapi • ft_striteri • ft_putchar_fd

These are the functions that i have created for my personal library.
FT stands for 42

# Technical considerations
• Declaring global variables is forbidden.
• If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static
functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
• Place all your files at the root of your repository.
• Turning in unused files is forbidden.
• Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
• You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command is forbidden.
• Your libft.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
